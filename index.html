              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
              environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
              connected to the objects of its environment to provide
              programmatic control over them.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>

            <ul class="ul-list-article">
              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
                a database, provide continuity of information from one
                invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.

              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java
              but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="text-article">
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
              small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
              string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
              instead of the more common class-based object model. The
              prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what
              is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
              supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
              Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
              methods.

              JavaScript andJavaScript is a very free-form language compared to
              Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
              methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
              public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement
              interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are
              not explicitly typed. Java are similar in some ways but
              fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language

              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.

              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
              or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits
              (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
              through "z" (lowercase).

              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

              When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called
              a global variable, because it is available to any other code in
              the current document. When you declare a variable within a
              function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
              only within that function.
            </p>
            <p class="text-article">
              JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
              scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
              function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
              example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is
              the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not
              the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>

            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
            <p class="text-article">

              in ECMAScript 2015.

              Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In
              web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access
              global variables using the window.variable syntax.

            <p class="text-article">
              Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one
              window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the
              window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
              phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
              variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
              The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
              and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <code> const PI = 3.14; </code>
            <p class="text-article">
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
              re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized
              to a value.
            </p>
            <p class="text-article">
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
              scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
              is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-article">
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
              variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
              // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS

            <p class="text-article">
              However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
              statement is executed without problems.
            </p>
            <code>
              const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = <br />

              can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have
              multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
              if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { <br />
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              <br />
              statement_last; }
            </code>
            <p class="text-article">
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical
              condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
              multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... })
              . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
              especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <code>
              if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br />
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br />
              statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br />
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }<br />
            </code>
            <p class="text-article">
              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
              expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality
              when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following
              code:
            </p>
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <p>
              If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
              common practice is to put additional parentheses around the
              assignment. For example:
            </p>
            <code> if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ } </code>

            <p class="text-article">
              A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
              condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code> while (condition) statement </code>
            <p class="text-article">
              If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
              executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
            </p>
            <p class="text-article">
              The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
              executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and
              the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
              execution stops and control is passed to the statement following
              while.
            </p>
            <p class="text-article">
              To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
              group those statements.
            </p>

            <p class="text-article">Example:</p>
            <p class="text-article">
              The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
            </p>
            <code> var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } </code>
            <p class="text-article">
              With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to
              x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
            <ul class="ul-list-article">
              <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
              <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-article">
              After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer
              true, so the loop terminates.

          <article>
            <p class="text-article">
              A function definition (also called a function declaration, or
              function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            </p>
            <ul class="ul-list-article">
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>
                A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                separated by commas.
              </li>
              <li>
                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                curly brackets, { }.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-article">
              For example, the following code defines a simple function named
              square:
            </p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p class="text-article">
              The function square takes one argument, called number. The
              function consists of one statement that says to return the
              argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
              The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p class="text-article">
              Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
              value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
              changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
              globally or in the calling function.
